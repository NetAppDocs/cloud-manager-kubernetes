You can use Cloud Manager to install or upgrade Astra Trident, configure storage classes, remove clusters, and enable data services.

NOTE: Astra Trident deployed using `tridentctl` is not supported. If you deployed Astra Trident using `tridentctl`, you cannot use Cloud Manager to manage your Kubernetes clusters. You must link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-managing-k8s/uninstall-trident.html#uninstall-by-using-tridentctl[uninstall using `tridentctl`^] and reinstall link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy-operator.html[using the Trident operator^]. 

== Features

After adding Kubernetes clusters to Cloud Manager, you can manage the clusters from the resource page. To open the resource page, double-click the Kubernetes working environment on the Canvas.

From the resource page you can:

* View the Kubernetes cluster status.
* Confirm a compatible version of Astra Trident is installed, or upgrade to the latest version of Astra Trident. See link:./task/task-k8s-manage-trident.html[Install Astra Trident].
* Add and remove storage classes. See link:./task/task-k8s-manage-storage-classes.html[Manage storage classes].
* View persistent volumes. See link:./task/task-k8s-manage-persistent-volumes.html[View persistent volumes].
* Remove Kubernetes clusters from the workspace. See link:./task/task-k8s-manage-remove-cluster.html[Remove clusters].
* Activate or view Cloud Backup. See link:./task/task-kubernetes-enable-services.html[Use NetApp cloud data services].
